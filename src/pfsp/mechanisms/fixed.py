    The deterministic schedule cycles through the operators in the order in

    move, the sweep is restarted from the first operator.  This behaviour is
    achieved by letting :meth:`select_operator` return ``None`` once the end of
    the list is reached; the metaheuristic resets the mechanism when it wants
    to restart the sweep.
